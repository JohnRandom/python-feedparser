               <p>
                        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                        possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                        free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
                      
               </p>
               <p>
                        To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                        the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                      
               </p>
               <p>
                        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

                        If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                        when it starts in an interactive mode:
                      
               </p>

                        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
                        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
                      
               </p>
               <p>
                        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                        parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                        be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                        mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

               <p>
                        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                        school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                        necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
                      
               </p>

                        `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
